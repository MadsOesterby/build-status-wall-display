| Requirement ID | Description                | User Story                                                                                                                                                                     | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| REQ-BSWD-001     | Configure which GitHub Actions workflows to show | As a user, I should be able to configure which GitHub Actions CI workflows should be shown on the web page via a json file | The configured GitHub Actions workflows should each show as a box on the front page of the web page. In the box, the name of the workflow should be shown. |
| REQ-BSWD-002     | Show build status        | As a user, I want to be able to see the build status of each build. | If the last build of a given workflow failed, then the box representing that workflow should be red. If the last build succeeded then the box should be green. If it is currently building then the box should show red or green based on the success or failure of the last build that finished, but there should be a small icon indicating that a build is running. If we cannot determine the status of the build, the box should be grey. |
| REQ-BSWD-003     | Failures should be explained | As a user, I want to be able to tell what went wrong if the build status could not be determined | If the workflow status could not be determined, it should be possible to mouse over a small icon that will show a tool tip explaining the reason for the failure. |
