# ASP.NET Core Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing ASP.NET Core applications to improve code quality, maintainability, performance, and security.

## Architecture and Project Structure

1. **Follow Clean Architecture principles**
   - Separate your application into layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access)
   - Use dependency injection to maintain loose coupling between layers
   - Implement the Repository and Unit of Work patterns for data access

2. **Organize code by feature rather than by type**
   - Group related components (controllers, models, services) by feature/domain
   - Makes codebase more navigable and maintainable as it grows

3. **Use Areas for larger applications**
   - Divide application into functional segments using Areas
   - Each area can have its own controllers, views, and models

## Configuration and Environment

1. **Use the Options Pattern for configuration**
   - Create strongly-typed configuration classes
   - Register them using `services.Configure<TOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("SectionName"))`
   - Inject `IOptions<TOptions>` where needed

2. **Environment-specific configuration**
   - Use environment-specific appsettings files (appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Production.json)
   - Use User Secrets for development secrets (not appsettings.json)
   - Use environment variables or a secure service like Azure Key Vault for production secrets

3. **Logging best practices**
   - Configure different log levels for different environments
   - Include relevant context in logs (request IDs, user IDs, etc.)
   - Use structured logging (e.g., Serilog, NLog) for better querying

## Performance Optimization

1. **Use Async/Await consistently**
   - Use async/await for I/O bound operations (database queries, HTTP requests, file operations)
   - Avoid blocking calls in async methods
   - Return Task<T> from controller actions that perform async operations

2. **Implement caching strategically**
   - Use Response Caching middleware for static or semi-static content
   - Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider distributed caching (Redis) for web farms
   - Use the IMemoryCache interface for application data caching

3. **Optimize database access**
   - Use Entity Framework efficiently (avoid N+1 query problems)
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Use compiled queries for frequently used operations
   - Consider Dapper for performance-critical operations

4. **Implement output caching**
   - Cache entire responses where appropriate
   - Use cache profiles in `Startup.cs` to standardize cache headers

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user management
   - Implement JWT or cookie authentication properly
   - Use policy-based authorization with custom requirements where needed
   - Implement proper role and claims-based security

2. **Protect against common vulnerabilities**
   - Use Anti-forgery tokens for forms
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Enable HTTPS and set secure cookie policies
   - Use Content Security Policy headers
   - Protect against XSS by using tag helpers and Html.Encode

3. **Input validation**
   - Validate input on both client and server sides
   - Use model validation attributes
   - Implement custom validators for complex rules
   - Use FluentValidation for more complex validation scenarios

4. **API security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use proper authentication for APIs
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Return appropriate status codes and error messages

## Dependency Injection

1. **Register services with appropriate lifetimes**
   - Transient: Created each time they're requested
   - Scoped: Created once per client request
   - Singleton: Created once for the application lifetime
   - Be careful with scoped services in singleton services (can cause memory leaks)

2. **Favor constructor injection**
   - Makes dependencies explicit
   - Easier to test with mocks

3. **Use interface-based design**
   - Program to interfaces, not implementations
   - Makes unit testing easier with mocked dependencies

## Error Handling

1. **Implement global exception handling**
   - Use middleware to catch and log exceptions
   - Provide user-friendly error pages or responses
   - Return appropriate status codes for API responses

2. **Use custom exception classes**
   - Create domain-specific exceptions
   - Include relevant information for troubleshooting

3. **Proper logging of exceptions**
   - Log the full exception details including inner exceptions
   - Include contextual information (user, action, parameters)
   - Don't log sensitive information

## Testing

1. **Write unit tests for business logic**
   - Test service classes and domain logic
   - Use mocking frameworks (Moq, NSubstitute) for dependencies
   - Aim for high code coverage of business logic

2. **Implement integration tests**
   - Test actual database operations with test database
   - Use the TestServer for testing HTTP requests
   - Test authentication and authorization

3. **Use testing frameworks**
   - xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest
   - FluentAssertions for readable assertions
   - Consider BDD-style tests with SpecFlow for complex scenarios

## API Design

1. **Follow RESTful principles**
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Return appropriate status codes
   - Use resource-based URLs

2. **Implement API versioning**
   - Prepare for changes by implementing versioning from the start
   - Consider URL, query string, or header-based versioning

3. **Document APIs**
   - Use Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
   - Include example requests and responses
   - Document all possible response codes

4. **Return consistent response formats**
   - Define standard response objects
   - Include metadata (pagination info, error details) when necessary

## Additional Best Practices

1. **Use Background Services for long-running tasks**
   - Implement IHostedService for background processing
   - Use BackgroundService for continuous background tasks

2. **Implement health checks**
   - Add health check endpoints for infrastructure components
   - Include in deployment pipelines and monitoring

3. **Implement proper logging and monitoring**
   - Use Application Insights or similar for production monitoring
   - Log key application events and performance metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

4. **Code style and standards**
   - Follow a consistent naming convention
   - Use analyzers and code quality tools (StyleCop, FxCop)
   - Implement code reviews as part of development process

5. **Deployment and DevOps**
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement infrastructure as code
   - Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployments

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Implement proper validation**
   - Use data annotations or FluentValidation
   - Implement validation filters or middleware
   - Return consistent validation error responses

2. **Implement proper localization**
   - Use resource files for text
   - Support multiple cultures
   - Implement proper date/time/number formatting

3. **Use middleware effectively**
   - Create custom middleware for cross-cutting concerns
   - Order middleware correctly in the pipeline

By following these best practices, you can create ASP.NET Core applications that are maintainable, secure, and performant.
